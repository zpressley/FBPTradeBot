# KAP Draft Pick Calculation System

## ⚠️ Important: This is Preview/Calculation Only

This system provides **preview and validation** during the KAP process. No changes are made until the manager clicks "Submit KAP" at the end.

**Staged Actions (Preview Only):**
- Draft pick calculation and preview
- Tax bracket validation
- Roster math and display
- Warning messages

**When Changes Actually Happen:**
- ✅ "Submit KAP" button → Backend updates `draft_order_2026.json`
- ✅ Backend sets `taxed_out: true` for taxed picks
- ✅ Backend finalizes keeper list and spending

**Exception:** Buy-in purchases (R1, R2, R3) happen immediately with their own confirmation modal. See `KAP_BUYIN_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Complete Calculation Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Buy-In Penalty (Rounds Lost)**
- Each buy-in purchased removes 1 round from the end
- 0 buy-ins: Rounds 1-29 available (29 picks)
- 1 buy-in: Rounds 1-28 available (28 picks)
- 2 buy-ins: Rounds 1-27 available (27 picks)
- 3 buy-ins: Rounds 1-26 available (26 picks)

**2. Roster Math**
- Calculate: 26 - keeper_count = picks_needed

**3. Roster Limit Filter**
- Take first N picks from available rounds
- Remove excess picks from the end

**4. Tax Bracket Validation**
- Verify team has ALL required picks for their spending tier
- BLOCK submission if missing required picks

**5. Draft Pick Tax**
- Remove picks in taxed rounds based on spending

### Calculation

#### Step 1: Buy-In Penalty
```

```

#### Step 2: Roster Math
```

Keepers: -10
Picks needed: 16
```

## Backend Integration

### API Payload
```json
{
  "team": "WIZ",
  "keepers": [...],
  "taxableSpend": 410,
  "draftPickUpdates": {
    "buyinRemoved": [331, 343],
    "rosterRemoved": [199, 211, 223, ...],
    "taxed": [55, 67, 79]
  }
}
```

### Draft Order Updates
Backend should update `draft_order_2026.json`:
- Set `taxed_out: true` for taxed picks (55, 67, 79)
- No changes needed for removed picks (they simply won't be used)

## Strategic Implications

### Buy-In Decision
- Each buy-in costs WizBucks AND removes a late-round pick
- R1 buy-in: $55 + lose R29
- R2 buy-in: $35 + lose R28
- R3 buy-in: $10 + lose R27

### Tax Bracket Planning
- Teams must carefully manage picks in rounds 4-10
- Trading away a taxed round pick = lose access to that spending tier
- Acquiring extra picks in key rounds = more spending flexibility

### Roster Construction
- More keepers = fewer draft picks needed
- Fewer draft picks = more rounds available for roster limit filter
- Strategic tension between keeping players vs. drafting
