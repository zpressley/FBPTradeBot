# FBP Hub Feature Status vs Original Plan

_As of 2026-01-09_

This document compares the original FBP Hub feature list (from the Claude plan) with what is actually implemented now across **fbp-hub** (website) and **fbp-trade-bot** (bot + data pipeline).

Status legend:
- ✅ **Complete** – implemented and in active use.
- 🟡 **Partial** – core pieces are in place, but flow is not fully wired or still missing polish.
- ❌ **Not implemented yet** – no meaningful implementation beyond maybe stubs.

---

## 1. "Complete Features" in the plan

### Player database with search/filters
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - `fbp-hub/players.html` + `js/players.js` implement full-text search, quick filters (keepers/prospects/my team), and advanced filters (position, MLB team, manager) over `combined_players.json`.

### Keeper roster displays
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - `rosters.html` + `js/rosters.js` render keeper depth charts by team, grouped by position buckets.
  - Uses `player_type === "MLB"` from `combined_players.json`.

### Prospect roster displays with contracts (FC/PC/DC)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - Prospect view on `rosters.html` shows farm players with FC/PC/DC badges (derived from `years_simple`), plus summary counts.

### MLB stats integration (current season)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete (backend)**
  - `fbp-trade-bot` maintains `player_stats.json` from Yahoo/MLB stats.
  - Service-time and prospect database logic use current MLB stats; website isn’t a full stats front-end, but the core integration is there.

### Service time progress bars
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - Backend: service-time calculations and limit flags exist (`service_time/` plus `service_stats.json`).
  - Frontend: graduation logic in `transactions.js` uses stats to detect graduates, but there is not yet a fully polished, everywhere-visible “progress bar” UI.

### Daily data pipeline automation
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - Scripts like `data_pipeline/update_all.py` and `service_time/daily_service_tracker.py` orchestrate the full pipeline.
  - Execution is manual / via external scheduler; there’s no in-repo cron/worker wiring, but the pipeline itself is ready and in use.

### MLB ID mapping system
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - `data_pipeline/build_upid_database.py`, `mlb_id_cache.json`, `upid_database.json`, and `mlb_team_map.json` are implemented and used by `merge_players.py` to attach `mlb_id` and reconcile identities.

### Roster event logging
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial → Strong foundation**
  - Historical roster events are captured via the Player Log Google Sheet and the 4 History Book CSVs.
  - These are normalized into `data/transactions_history.json` and surfaced in the new `player-log.html`.
  - New JSON log `data/player_log.json` + `player_log.append_entry(...)` exist and the initial admin sync script is in place, but most bot flows are not yet writing into this log.

### Service days calculation
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - Service-day calculations and storage in `service_stats.json` are implemented and used by bot commands and graduation-eligibility checks.

### Flagging system for graduation candidates
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - Backend: service-time flags for exceeding MLB/FBP limits exist.
  - Frontend: `transactions.js` computes `eligibleGraduations` from service stats for the user’s prospects.
  - Still missing: end-to-end self-service action that actually updates rosters/contracts + logs the transaction through the bot.

### Player lookup command (bot)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - Discord `/player` / `/lookup` commands are implemented and backed by `combined_players.json` via `commands/lookup.py`.

### Roster view command (bot)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - Discord `/roster` command returns rosters per team, backed by `combined_players.json` and pipeline data.

### Standings command (bot)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - `/standings` uses `data/standings.json` and is wired into the bot.

### Trade submission command (bot)
- **Planned status:** Complete
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - `/trade` + `commands/trade_logic.py` implement trade submission and approval threads in Discord.

## 2. "Partially Complete Features" in the plan

### Transaction ledger
- **Planned status:** Partial
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial (two ledgers, good foundation)**
  - **WizBucks ledger**: `wizbucks.json` + `wizbucks_transactions.json` + `wizbucks.html` provide a working currency ledger with filters and balances. This part is effectively complete.
  - **Global player transaction log**: `transactions_history.json` (History Book) + `player_log.json` (new log) + `player-log.html` now give a unified historical view with season/owner/type/search filters.
  - **Still missing:** routine bot flows (trades, promotions, etc.) writing their own entries into `player_log.json` beyond the pending admin roster-sync script.

### Self-service transactions (graduations, DC slots)
- **Planned status:** Partial
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - `transactions.html` + `js/transactions.js`:
    - Authenticate manager (via existing auth system) and show eligible graduations and DC slot availability for their team.
    - UI for “Graduate to R-4” and “Buy DC Slot” is present but currently only logs to console / shows toasts.
  - No Cloudflare worker / bot integration yet to actually mutate rosters, contracts, or WizBucks – so it’s UI-only at this stage.

### 30-man roster compliance tracker
- **Planned status:** Partial
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented (just a stub)**
  - `transactions.js` has a placeholder `check30ManCompliance()` and static messaging indicating Yahoo API integration is “coming soon”.
  - No real compliance logic or persistence yet.

### Trade submission (web alternative)
- **Planned status:** Partial
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - All trade flows are still Discord-first (`/trade`); there is no functioning web form or API endpoint for initiating trades.

### WizBucks installment tracking (PAD/PPD/APA)
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - No `wizbucks_installments.json` or PAD/PPD/APA-specific logic exists yet.

### Keeper salary calculator with tax brackets
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - There is a `salaries.html` page stub and some draft logic, but no full tax-bracket-aware calculator or persisted `keeper_salaries.json`.

### Draft pick tracker
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - `fbp-hub/data/draft_picks.json` and a `draft-picks.html` page exist with a read-only view.
  - `fbp-trade-bot` does not yet maintain draft-pick state as a first-class JSON in `data/`, and picks aren’t integrated into the Player Log or WizBucks system.

### Manager authentication (Discord OAuth)
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial → Working but can be hardened**
  - `auth.js`, `login.html`, and `callback.html` integrate with a Cloudflare Worker for Discord OAuth.
  - Auth is used to identify the manager/team in the dashboard and transactions pages.
  - Remaining work is mostly around production hardening and deeper authorization checks on sensitive actions.

### Photo upload tool (Wikimedia + manual)
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - No `photo_queue.json`, upload UI, or pipeline exists yet.

---

## 4. "Not Implemented – Manager Actions" in the plan

### Personal draft boards
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial (backend)**
  - `data/manager_boards_2025.json` exists and is used by `draft/board_manager.py` + `/board` commands to manage per-team boards.
  - Web UI for viewing/editing personal boards is not yet built.

### Keeper deadline form (salary/IL tag decisions)
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - No dedicated web form or JSON (`keeper_decisions_2026.json`) yet; decisions are still managed via sheets/Discord.

---

---

## 7. "Not Implemented – Missing High-Priority Features" in the plan

### Service time alerts command
- **Actual:** ❌ Not implemented as a dedicated command, though data exists.

### Prospect graduation command
- **Actual:** ❌ Not implemented as a one-shot `/graduate` command; logic is partially present in UI and service-time flags.

## 8. "Not Implemented – Website Features" in the plan

### Static website foundation
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete**
  - Multi-page static site (`index`, `players`, `rosters`, `dashboard`, `wizbucks`, `auction`, `transactions`, `player-log`, etc.) is in place with consistent styling and nav.

### Authentication system
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** 🟡 **Partial**
  - Discord OAuth via Cloudflare Worker and `auth.js` is implemented and used by dashboard + transactions.
  - Still needs more guardrails and integration into all sensitive flows.

### Manager dashboard
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ✅ **Complete (first version)**
  - `dashboard.html` shows team-specific stats, quick actions, and a compact roster depth chart driven by `combined_players.json` and auth.

### Web-triggered bot actions
- **Planned status:** Not implemented
- **Actual:** ❌ **Not implemented**
  - No end-to-end flow where a web action directly calls a worker/API that then drives the Discord bot. All “actions” are still Discord-first.

---

## 9. "Not Implemented – Data Files Needed" in the plan

---

## 10. Summary

- Many items originally flagged as "Not Implemented" (static website, dashboard, transaction history, some data files) are now **fully or largely complete**.
- The biggest remaining gaps are:
  - Wiring **self-service actions** (graduations, DC, compliance) and **web-triggered workflows** all the way through the bot and logs.
  - Implementing the keeper salary/IL/tag ecosystem and draft-related financial tools.
  - Building the more advanced/"cool" UX layers (team pages, player history views, admin console, auction portal UI).
- The **data foundation** (combined players, UPID/MLB IDs, stats, WizBucks, transaction history) is in good shape; most new features can now be layered on top of this without needing large new pipelines.
